                    <p>Edward and Alphonse Elric’s journey to recover their bodies after a mistaken attempt to bring
                        their
                        mother back to life using alchemy is definitely one of the most captivating stories in anime.
                        That’s
                        why it’s no surprise Hiromu Arakawa’s manga received a second adaptation once it was clear her
                        story
                        was winding down.</p>
                    <p>Admittedly, <a class="fullmetal" href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood/"

                        parts
                        aren’t quite as strong as the original series as it moves too fast. But that’s because it has so
                        much more to get to. New plot twists and character development come at a breathless pace before
                        finally giving viewers a wonderfully satisfying ending, providing fans with not only one of the
                        best
                        shonen anime ever but one of the best anime ever.</p>

                        poor
                        decision or run into the wrong character, and wind up very, very dead. This is a world where,
                        more
                        often than not, even the main character is struggling to avoid being killed by vastly more
                        powerful
                        opponents, creating a constant sense of tension even when they’re in the midst of a grand
                        adventure.

                    <p>Before reinventing itself as a seinen with the beginning of Steel Ball Run, <a class="fullmetal"
                            href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/jojos-bizarre-adventure/" target="_blank">JoJo's Bizarre
                            Adventure</a> was a revolutionary title in the shonen genre. It's been going on since the
                        late
                        '80s, and Hirohiko Araki is showing no signs of slowing down. Anybody who calls themselves a fan
                        of
                        shonen needs to watch this anime.</p>
                    <p>JoJo's is a generational storyline that constantly reinvents itself. It's a true ground-breaker
                        for
                        the genre, and with every new part, its campiness and absurdity only increase. JoJo's has become
                        such a cultural phenomenon that other anime series blatantly reference it. Most notably, other
                        series have incorporated the "menacing" onomatopoeia, and some characters have done JoJo's poses
                        or
                        mimicked the Joestars' battle cries.</p>

                            Communicate</a> is another anime that proves shonen isn't all about action-packed battles
                        and
                        intense characters. Its manga was published in Weekly Shonen Sunday, making it a definite shonen
                        title. Komi Can't Communicate follows Komi Shoko, a high schooler with severe social anxiety
                        that
                        makes it extremely difficult for her to talk to other people. However, she has a goal of making
                        100
                        friends by the end of her high school career.</p>
                    <p>Enter Tadano, Komi's first friend who found that communicating through written notes is an
                        effective
                        way of talking. From there, Komi's life turns upside down as she befriends the entire school and
                        experiences all kinds of wacky things along the way. Komi Can't Communicate has a lovable
                        ensemble
                        cast with all kinds of personalities, from the emo otaku, Nakanaka to the chaotic nonbinary
                        spitfire, Najimi.</p>

                    <p>There are some pretty strong arguments for Eiichiro Oda’s saga of Monkey D. Luffy and his gang of
                        pirates in search of ultimate treasure being the best shonen series of them all. It stands as
                        the
                        most popular of Shonen Jump’s "big three" over twenty years after it began, and Oda just keeps
                        surprising people with new reveals and callbacks to plotlines from years prior.</p>
                    <p>Supposedly, Oda is almost done with the storyline now. However, if there’s one flaw to One Piece,
                        it
                        has to be the pacing. Twenty years of storytelling means the anime has to use quite a few tricks
                        to
                        slow things down and not outpace the manga.</p>

                            Ball Z</a> isn’t the first shonen anime ever, it’s definitely the most influential. In one
                        way
                        or another, almost every other hit shonen series has taken inspiration from Dragon Ball Z. After
                        all, a shonen series is nothing without transformations and training sequences. Even time skips
                        were
                        popularized with this series.</p>
                    <p>Dragon Ball Z’s lack of character development and generally simplistic plots can leave something
                        to
                        be desired even amongst shonen fans, but one must pay homage to the genre’s origins and
                        acknowledge
                        Dragon Ball Z as one of the most popular series of all time.</p>

                    <p>Masashi Kishimoto’s story of a young ninja rejected by his city and working to one day become the
                        leader of his village captured the imagination of every kid and teenager who grew up in the
                        2000s.
                        Alongside Bleach and One Piece, Naruto would become part of Shonen Jump’s "big three." While
                        Bleach
                        lost quite a bit of its luster by the end, Naruto was just as strong as ever when it finished

                        popular
                        it even wound up inspiring a legacy manga series based on Naruto’s son, Boruto, adding a
                        generational aspect to the series. The only thing holding this series back from even greater
                        heights
                        is the absurd amount of filler.</p>

                        offer.
                        The lead Best Boy is Izuku Midoriya, a young teenager who starts out without superpowers in a
                        world
                        where almost everyone has a Quirk. When Midoriya meets his idol and biggest superhero of them
                        all,
                        All Might, he winds up pulled into an adventure that will lead to him becoming the greatest hero
                        ever.</p>

                            Academia</a> might not be doing anything wholly new, but author Kohei Horikoshi is taking
                        the
                        tropes of the genre and executing them better than anyone else in the game right now. The only
                        thing
                        holding the series back is it's simply too new, with the franchise only starting in 2016.</p>

                            class="fullmetal">Assassination Classroom</a> takes place at Kunugigaoka Middle School. It's
                        an
                        elite school with a harsh hierarchy system, and the academy's lowest performers are exiled to a
                        building off campus for their studies. Class 3-E had little to no chance of improving their
                        grades
                        until Koro-sensei came along. He's an eccentric monster who resembles a big yellow octopus and
                        Class
                        3-E must successfully assassinate him before he destroys the planet.</p>
                    <p>Assassination Classroom has a lovable cast of characters. Though the students are supposed to
                        kill
                        him, it's extremely hard to dislike Koro-sensei. He's the best teacher these kids have had. Most
                        of
                        Assassination Classroom is lighthearted, fun, and upbeat, but its ending is a real tear-jerker.
